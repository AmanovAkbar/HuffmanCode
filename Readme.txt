How To Run on windows:

java -jar --module-path "javafx-sdk-18.0.1\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls, javafx.fxml Huffman.jar

___________________________________________________________

This is because javafx was deprecated, so I needed to download Openfx sdk and add it as User Library
When I wrote this code Javafx was still a part of java. In fact it still runs as intended on my old laptop.
